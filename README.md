# Project 1 - No Thanks! Web-game

## Game Flow
### tl; dr
*For full game tutorial, see following section.*

- 3-5 players
- 25 cards in deck (with values ranging from 1-35)
- 10 marbles each
- starts with one card played from deck
- players give marble or take card
- ends when all 25 cards are drawn
- win by scoring lowest points

### Game Tutorial

This is a 3-5 player game with the objective of scoring the **lowest** points.

There is a **deck of 25 cards**, each with a **value ranging from 1 to 35**. Every player begins with **10 marbles**. The game starts with a card played from the deck. Each player is given the option to **take the card**, or to **give a marble**.

If a player decides to give a marble, it will **accumulate** in the marble pool. If a player decides to take a card, they take with them **all the marbles in the pool**, adding to their current number of marbles. The game ends when **all cards in the deck are drawn**.

Scores are tabulated by **totalling the value of each card**. If cards of consecutive values are drawn, only the **smallest value of the consecutive numbers will be counted**. The **number of marbles owned will also be subtracted** from the score.


## Most challenging part of the project
- to determine the right data structure
- displaying cards in ascending order immediately after a card is taken
- updating values/texts as the game progresses
- eliminating extreme conditions
- designing the whole look of the game and positioning things where I want them to be


## Further work and next steps
- allow for more players
- have a change in data according to the total number of players
- make the webpage look nicer c:
